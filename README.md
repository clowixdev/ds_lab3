### NoteBookApp

It is necessary to develop a program that implements the functionality of the business notebook: 

1) storing objects of the "event" type:
   
        - year, month, date, hour, minute of the event 
        - day of the week 
        - description of the event (text) 
        - place of the event (text) 
        - importance (0-10) 
  
3) the ability to add new events 
4) the ability to delete events 
5) display of all events on the screen:

        - ability to sort events by date 
        - ability to sort events by importance 
        - the ability to filter events by location

7) the ability to save and load events from a file (the same one) 
  
Requirements:

    - "foolproof" must be implemented, which will not allow incorrect data to be entered into fields 
    - the day of the week should be calculated automatically 
    - event storage should be implemented based on binary search trees 
    - sorting should be implemented using tree traversal 
    - the filter should also work on substrings 
    - the event storage structure should be optimal in logic and memory
